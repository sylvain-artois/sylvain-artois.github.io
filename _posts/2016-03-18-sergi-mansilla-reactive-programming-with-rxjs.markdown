> If an action has impact outside of the scope where it happens, we call this a **side effect**. Changing a variable external to our function, printing to the console, or updating a value in a database are example of side effects.
> That means our function is not in control anymore and it can't assume that external variable contains the value we expect. Although side effects are necessary to build any interesting program, we should strive for having as few as possible in our code.
