> Which is to say, the differences in style between these two projects aren’t just arbitrary preferences. They’re very definite, derived expressions, representative of a certain mood over time.
> **Bootstrap** reads very fun, not serious—nearly every line is a joke. It’s trying to provoke you. Taking shortcuts. Demanding that you reread it. Reread it again. It’s very pop. Very optimistic. Forward. Playful. 
> The code for **Ratchet** is very different. It’s very conservative. It’s not meant to draw attention to itself. It’s very explicit. Assertive, necessary. It’s easy to approach. It’s a vanilla milkshake.
